# Storage Selector

Starting with Mbed OS 5.10 the operating system itself offers facilities for handling the storage (get_default_instance). With Mbed OS 5.11 internal flash is also fully supported even for storage.

This repository will not be maintained going onwards, as the work will be done using the [official Mbed OS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os) repository.

For more details, please see [Mbed OS storage documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v5.11/reference/storage-tech.html). 

There are also multiple examples available:

- [mbed-os-example-blockdevice](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blockdevice)
- [mbed-os-example-filesystem](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-filesystem)
- [mbed-os-example-kvstore](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-kvstore)
